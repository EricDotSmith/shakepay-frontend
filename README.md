![](https://github.com/EricDotSmith/shakepay-frontend/blob/main/app_demo.gif)

This web app is a simplified interface for viewing and managing the crypto assets from the Shakepay frontend assessment. It is designed to be responsive, so it will work on a variety of screen sizes and devices. It uses the Shakepay API to retrieve data about the crypto assets and transactions. It also demonstrates the new NextJS 13 and React 18 features such as server components, Suspense, API caching, app folder structure, etc.

## Features

- Display a list of the crypto assets and their current balances
- View the transaction history for each asset, including details such as date, type, and amount
- NextJS 13 example app
